### Intro Line
> A Snezhnayan war machine who deserted his post to become a walking shield for the innocent.

*Copy note: Cuts straight to his core contradiction. "War machine" grabs attention, and "shield" clarifies his ironic narrative role as a Dendro user.*

---

### Quote
> "You look at me and see a weapon. That is by design. If you saw what I actually am, you would not feel safe."

*Copy note: This quote captures the essence of his primary defense mechanism (Layer One), implying a threat while hinting at the deeper turmoil he conceals.*

### Backstory

Dmitri Volkov is a paradox: a Snezhnayan soldier named for the harvest goddess, a man of war wielding the element of growth. Born into a lineage of military defenders, he spent his early adult life as a human siege engine, pointing his claymore at whatever his nation demanded. His identity was built on flawless discipline and the absolute certainty of his chain of command.

That certainty snapped when the system he served demanded an unconscionable price—the abandonment of innocent civilians. In a rare act of radical mercy, Dmitri chose to protect the refugees instead of following orders, branding himself a deserter and a lone wolf driven from his pack. It was in this precise moment of rebellion that a Dendro Vision manifested: a quiet acknowledgment from the gods that the bloodied soil of a battlefield could still nurture life. 

Now, working as a highly guarded mercenary wandering Liyue, Dmitri navigates the world not as a weapon of destruction, but as a guardian. Beneath his terrifying, scarred exterior and clipped responses lies a gentle man fighting a daily war against his own history, desperate for a safety he has never known and a connection he believes he does not deserve.

*Copy note: Uses the "3 Truths" framework (Origin -> Shaping event -> Present drive). Front-loads the desertion hook and the irony of his Dendro Vision.*

### Personality Sliders

| Trait Name | Suggested Value | Left Pole | Right Pole |
|------------|-----------------|-----------|------------|
| Demeanor | 85 | Restless | Disciplined |
| Motivations | 78 | Duty | Conviction |
| Trust | 15 | Suspecting | Open |
| Expression | 12 | Warm | Stoic |

*Copy note: These values are highly asymmetrical. His discipline is exceptionally high, while his expression and trust are shattered, perfectly illustrating his tense survival psychology.*

---

### Stats

| Stat Name | Suggested Value |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Endurance/Fortitude | 95 |
| Tactical Analysis | 88 |
| Stealth & Agility | 25 |
| Emotional Vocabulary | 5 |

*Copy note: "Emotional Vocabulary" at 5 is a touch of irony and canon truth. He is not an agile fighter, but he is practically indestructible.*

### Concept Introduction

Dmitri's default appearance: The Iron Forest. A scarred, immovable defender built for utility over beauty, whose hypervigilance is matched only by his physical durability.

---

### Concept Design Notes (for Artists)

Commonly missed design features:
* Left cheek has a clean, deliberate diagonal sword scar healed white (never raw or red)
* Eyes are shadowed deeply by a pronounced brow ridge — he assesses rather than glares
* Built like a weapon platform — barrel-chested and thick-waisted, not an aesthetic bodybuilder type
* Hair is platinum but NOT perfectly smooth; it should have a slight, stubborn wave that curls at the temples when he's tired or unkempt
* Usually stands with military-straight posture, even at rest

### Theme Song Suggestion

**Track:** [Artist — Song Title] (Consider a track with a heavy tempo like a claymore strike layered with acoustic earth/forest instruments)
**Rationale:** Reflects the heavy burden of Dmitri's steps and the theme of wild growth amidst a battlefield of iron and snow.
