### Backstory

The name "Lan Qingyu" is an exquisite fabrication, a title chosen by a dock worker's hungry daughter to rewrite her own destiny. Where others inherited wealth and respect, she had to engineer them entirely from scratch. Trading the cold reality of absolute poverty for the silken armor of high society, she transformed herself into the harbor's most indispensable intelligence broker—a woman whose smile is a weapon and whose information network rivals the Qixing's own.

Her ascent required the methodical erasure of her past, locking away the desperate, starving child she once was behind five layers of perfectly maintained persona. To Liyue's elite, she is the charming socialite; to clients, the ruthless broker; to close contacts, the sharp strategist. Her Dendro Vision perfectly reflects her true nature: a sprawling, interconnected root system operating unseen beneath polished floors, drawing sustenance from the secrets of others. 

Yet, creating an empire of leverage is an isolating endeavor. Surrounded by people who owe her, fear her, or find her useful, Qingyu remains fundamentally untouched and unseen. As the weight of thirty years of deception begins to strain her flawless architecture, the terrifying truth emerges: the girl who survived by becoming everyone else's necessity is finally longing to be someone's choice.

*Copy note: This narrative builds an emotional bridge (empathy hook) so the reader understands she is not simply an elegant sociopath, but a tired and lonely survivor.*

### Concept Introduction

The Mist Serpent. Graceful, elusive, and meticulously curated. A woman whose attire and accessories function as communicative misdirections.

---

### Concept Design Notes (for Artists)

Commonly missed design features:
* Eyes are deep amber (like aged honey or autumn leaves) but should convey *calculation*, not just warmth
* Her antique jade hairpin is a mandatory accessory—it is her sole physical anchor and should not be omitted or modernized
* Very faint, fine lines around the eyes (she is 44, not 24). They should suggest sophistication and intense observation, not severe aging
* Slender and elegant, but with the subtle lean muscle of a trained swordswoman hiding underneath the expensive silk. We do not want her to look frail
* Hands often feature expressive gestures in conversation

### Theme Song Suggestion

**Track:** [Artist — Song Title] (Select a traditional Liyue string instrument/Erhu that sways with an elegant rhythmic tempo but sounds *lonely* in its high notes).
**Rationale:** It must permeate the illusion of luxury she has built with the melancholic echoes of the starving young girl from her past that she tries to bury tightly.
